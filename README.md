Precomputed domains Evolutionary Framework
==========================================

Python wrapper for the maze navigation evolutionary robotics domain common across many of my publications.

The program is built using SCons (http://www.scons.org/)

Precomputed Data Files
----------------------

You'll need to download these to run the maze experiments.

* Hard maze data file: https://s3.amazonaws.com/precomputed-maze/hard_maze.zip
* Medium maze data file: https://s3.amazonaws.com/precomputed-maze/medium_maze.zip

Dependencies
------------

Python dependencies:
* Numpy
* Numba (http://numba.pydata.org/)
* Scipy 


Quick-start
-----------

Download one or both of the precomputed maze domain files (hard_maze.zip and/or medium_maze.zip) and unzip them into the logs subdirectory.

Then you should be able to run demo.py
